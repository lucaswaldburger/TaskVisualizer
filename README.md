# TaskVisualizer

TaskVisualizer is a simulator to visualize the Semiprotocols from the TaskMaster 2.0. Unlike the PipetteAid, this will feature a PCR and tube rack and will verify the sequence of events from a semiprotocol by handling well volume and tubes already present in the workspace. TaskVisualizer will significantly reduce the time required to debug the results from TaskMaster 2.0 as well as future TaskMaster assignments.
